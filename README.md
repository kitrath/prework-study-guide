# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a single webpage built for the prework section of a bootcamp that begins at the end of November 2022. This project familiarizes the learner with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, working locally with Git, collaborating on GitHub using the "GitHub flow", and deployment of static sites to GitHub pages.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The learner can add notes to each section (HTML, CSS, JS, and Git) during the course of the bootcamp by modifying [index.html](./index.html).  Use `Command+Shift+I` on Mac, or `Control+Shift+I` on Windows to open the Developer Tools console. In the Dev Tools console, the JS running on the page offers a suggestion of which subject to study first.
